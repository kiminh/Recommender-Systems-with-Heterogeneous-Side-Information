# HIRE_0f34z57i8u

This is a tiny demo code for HIRE on movielens-100k dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Training

In data file, training data has been defined with name u1.base, u2.base, u3.base, u4.base, u5.base, also we have already built hierarchy matrix and flat feature matrix for users and movies in .txt form.

All you need is to run train.py in terminal.

## Evaluating
Test data has been defined with name u1.test, u2.test, u3.test, u4.test, u5.test in data file.

RMSE loss will be printed for five fold test data when you run train.py.

## Dataset
The dataset is a copy of the MovieLens | GroupLens 
dataset in the `MovieLens 100k | GroupLens <http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip/>`_
